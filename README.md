Command txt is a templating language for shell programming.

##Input
The input to the template comes from stdin.
It is parsed in one of four ways.

The default is to split stdin into records and fields, using the -R and -F
flags respectively, similar to awk(1), and dot is set to a list of lists
of string.

If the -csv flag, or the -header flag, is specified, stdin is treated as
a CSV file, as recognized by the encoding/csv package.
If the -header flag is not specified, the first record is used as the header.
Dot is set to a list of maps, with the header for each column as the key.

If the -json flag is specified, stdin is treated as JSON.
Dot is set as the decoded JSON.

If the -no-stdin flag is specified, stdin is not read.
Dot is not set.

##Templates
The templating language is documented at http://golang.org/pkg/text/template
with the single difference that if the first line at the top of the file
begins with #! that line is skipped.
If the -html flag is used, escaping functions are automatically added to all
outputs based on context.

Any command line arguments after the flags are treated as filenames
of templates.
The templates are named after the basename of the respective filename.
The first file listed is the main template, unless the -template flag
specifies otherwise.
If the -e flag is used to define an inline template, it is always the main
template, and the -template flag is illegal.

##Functions
Built in functions are documented at
http://golang.org/pkg/text/template#hdr-Functions

The following additional functions are defined:

```
readCSV headerspec filename
	headerspec is a comma-separated list of headers or "" to use the headers
	in filename.
	Dot is set to the contents of the CSV file as with -csv.
	If the file cannot be opened or its contents are malformed, execution
	stops.

readJSON filename
	Read the JSON encoded file into dot or halt execution if decoding fails
	or the file cannot be opened.
	Dot is set to the contents of the JSON file as with -json.

read RS FS filename
	Read filename with the default record and file splitting as specified
	by the RS and FS regular expressions.
	If RS or FS are "", the respective value of -R or -F is used.

quoteCSV string
	Apply the appropriate CSV quoting rules to string.

toJSON what
	Encode what as JSON. Execution halts if
	http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal errors.

readFile filename
	Read filename completely as a single string.
	Execution halts if the file cannot be read.

equalFold string-one string-two
	Reports whether the UTF-8 encoded string-one and string-two are equal
	under Unicode case-folding.

fields string
	Split string around whitespace.

join separator strings
	Join the list in strings by the string separator.

lower string
	Lowercase string.

upper string
	Uppercase string.

title string
	Titlecase string.

trim cutset string
	Return string with all leading and trailing runes in cutset removed.

trimLeft cutset string
	Return string with all leading runes in cutset removed.

trimRight cutset string
	Return string with all trailing runes in cutset removed.

trimPrefix prefix string
	Return string with prefix removed.

trimSuffix suffix string
	Return string with suffix removed.

trimSpace string
	Return string with all leading and trailing whitespace removed.

match pattern string
	Return whether string matches the regex in pattern.
	Execution halts if pattern is not a valid regular expression.

find pattern string
	Returns all substrings of string that match pattern.
	Execution halts if pattern is not a valid regular expression.

replace pattern spec string
	Replace all substrings in string matching pattern by spec.
	Execution halts if pattern is not a valid regular expression.

split pattern string
	Split string into a list of substrings separated by pattern.
	Execution halts if pattern is not a valid regular expression.

env key
	Returns the environment variable key or "".

exec name args*
	Execute command name with args. Stdin is nil.
	Stderr shares the stderr of txt(1).
	Stdout is returned as a string.

pipe name args* input
	Execute command name with args with input as stdin.
	Otherwise, like exec.
```
